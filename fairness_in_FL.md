    <h1>Fairness in Federated Learning</h1>
</center>



Federated learning (FL) is a framework that allows distributed learning for neural networks and other machine learning models. Disparate servers with private data iteratively 

  1) share learned model parameters with a central server and
  2) receive aggregated model parameters from the central server

We **tested a novel approach to improve individual fairness outcomes in Federated Learning**, without sacrificing privacy or accuracy. We use a feed forward Neural Network to classify recidivism cases from the COMPAS
dataset, and evaluate the individual and group fairness scores given through different algorithmic techniques.
