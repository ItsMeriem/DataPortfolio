# Outline

### High Level Summary
For my final project, I'd like to explore air pollution in the Pittsburgh area. Specifically, I'm interested in 
- (a) How  has air quality in Pittsburgh changed over time? And does that change correlate or align with the closing or relocation of steel or coal facilities; and
- (b) Which areas are most affected by air pollution in Pittsburgh? What are the demographics of the residents of areas most affected in terms of environmental justice demographics?

### Project Structure
First, I will start by a brief history of air quality in Pittsburgh, how the city came to be known as the ["City of Smoke"](https://e360.yale.edu/features/for-low-income-pittsburgh-clean-air-remains-an-elusive-goal), and explaining how the steel industry both helped Pittsbrugh prosper economically but also brought about environmental damage.

Then, I will dive into a map visualization of Pittsbrugh that shows how air quality has changed over time. I will focus on a couple metrics: PM 2.5 levels, Air Quality Index (AQI) and ozone pollution. This map will be interactive and users will be able to toggle from one year to the next to compare  yearly change. Users will be also be able to zoom in and out of the map. Fortunately, air quality in Pittsbrugh has [improved over time](https://e360.yale.edu/features/for-low-income-pittsburgh-clean-air-remains-an-elusive-goal), so I expect this part of the story to start off as positive and re-assuring to users.

In the next section, I look at how has the closure of power plants over time
The outline of your final project should serve as the building blocks for the rest of your presentation.  Your outline should be something that you can later use to help fill in some of the details around your project.  

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project.  
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.
