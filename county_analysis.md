<h1 align="center">Analysis of Mortality and Incarceration Risk Across Demographic Variables</h1>

<h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>
I conducted this analysis as part of a 3-hour long Data Challenge.<br><br>

The primary goal of this challenge is to analyze two datasets and prepare a cross-tabulation report that can help the county understand the relationship between various demographics (age, gender, etc) and the probability a person is at risk of death and incarceration.

<h3 align="center">Datasets</h3>
As part of this challenge, I was provided two datasets relating to one of the countyâ€™s welfare intervention programs:

1. **Demographics Dataset:** Contains demographics variables (age, sex, race, history of opiod use, etc) for each person 
2. **Risk Scores Dataset:** Includes out-of-sample risk scores for two outcomes (mortality and incarceration). These scores represent the estimated probability of a person being at risk of death and incarceration


<h3 align="center">Task and Methodology</h3>

I was tasked to analyze both datasets and create two cross-tabulations reports (one for mortality and one for incarceration) showing for each demographic category, the:

- **Population %:** The percentage of the population in the dataset with the variable
- **Avg Risk Score:** The average risk score for each category
- **Top 1%, 5% and 10%:** The average risk score for the top 1%, 5%, 10% highest risk scores within the category


The goal of the cross tabulation is to
1. Understand the demographic breakdown of the groups an intervention would be targeted towards if the model is used, and
2. Understand how risk level varies across groups (i.e. gender or age range or people with a history of opioid use).

```python
import pandas as pd

def calculate_statistics(outcome, categorical_features_list):
    
    """
    Calculates statistics for categorical demographic features based on a specified outcome, specifically:
    1. The percentage of the total population for each category within a categorical feature.
    2. The average predicted risk score for each category.
    3. The percentage breakdown of the riskiest population at different thresholds (Top 1%, 5%, and 10% risk levels).
    
    Parameters:
    ----------
    outcome : str
        The outcome variable to analyze. Must be one of:
        - 'ONE_YEAR_JAIL'
        - 'ONE_YEAR_MORTALITY'

    categorical_features_list : list of str
        A list of categorical column names

    Returns:
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        A formatted DataFrame containing:
        - 'Population %': Percentage of the total dataset belonging to each category.
        - 'Avg Risk Score': The average predicted probability of the specified outcome for each category.
        - 'Top_1%_score', 'Top_5%_score', 'Top_10%_score': Categorical breakdown of top 1%, 5%, and 10% of riskiest populations.
        - 'feature': The categorical feature being analyzed.
        - 'category': The specific category within the feature.
