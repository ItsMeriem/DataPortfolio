# My Projects

## [Automatic Speech Recognition Using Neural Networks](UtterancetoPhonemeMapping.ipynb)
Check out how I implemented an Automatic Speech Recognition network using RNNs (Bi-LSTMS, and p-BLSTMs), a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), and dynamic programming to process human speech into written text.

## [Fairness in Federated Learning](fairness_in_FL.md) 
My co-authors and I wrote a paper on how to improve individual and group-level fairness in Federated Learning. Check out our paper and our code.

## [Poorer Pennsylvania Residents are Dying of Steel](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/air-pollution-clairton-pa/index.html)
I wrote a story on how Pittsburgh's poorest residents live in a cancer hotspot and how local fine structures fail to ensure a safe environment.
