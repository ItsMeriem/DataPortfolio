**Welcome to my portfolio where I tell stories with data at CMU!** Here's where all my cool work will go. 

# About me

<img src="DSC_3375.jpg" width="200"/>

Hi!  I'm Meriem (she/her) and here's what you need to know about me:

📚 Current Public Policy & Data Analytics Masters Student at Carnegie Mellon University

💻 2+ years in data-driven environmental policy research and data science using Python and R

🎓 Dartmouth Grad with a Bachelor’s in Economics and Computer Science

🌍 Passionate about using data to tell stories

🚲 Love biking, kayaking and cooking


# What I hope to learn

1. How do I unearth stories in data and use visualizations in a way that conveys a story?
2. What are some softwares, languages or platforms that are best for data viz? I've worked with Python and R but I'm excited to learn new tools.
3. I want to get my hands dirty and practice data viz so I'm especially excited about the workshops and the final projects.
4. How can I make my visualizations accessible to as large of an audience as possible? How can I ensure that my color combinations and my fonts are accessible?
5. How to integrate interactive visualizations (from R Shiny or leaflet for example) on my potfolio site?
