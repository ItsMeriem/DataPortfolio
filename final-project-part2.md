# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience is Allegheny County residents generally. This story is meant for any Allegheny county residents who are able to take action towards building a safer future for the residents of Clairton, PA. This includes voters who can pressure local government officials to enforce environmental compliance. It also includes people (voters or non voters) who are able to work with advocacy groups to achieve change.

To identify a sample of interviewees that is representative of my target audience, I focused on people who live in Allegheny county. I made sure that my sample has a representative sample across age and gender. I also would like to ensure that my story is accessible to people without a data background so half of my interviewees do not have a data background.
Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story.

Miguel:

What is it telling uou? It tells me that the government does not care about poor people. Conflicted, sometimes I struggle with environmental racism. Poor people vs. race. The fine is really low. US does not care about the health outcomes associated with pollution. more interested in supporting steel industry. 
I wonder how often people are measuring air quality. No one is looking. It took them a long time to figure out it's that bad.

How long did it take people to realize that quality is bad? Was it because of cancer risk first and then realized that it was bad? 

That's low the fine - fine per violation here in US steel vs other places or vs EPA. is local gov less likely to fine? Most curious about the fines. These are the only things that companies will respond to!!!! 

Viz 3 --> label the y axis. Include th eunit. 

Go for the text first. the text helped yo uunderstand the graph. Reading the text first helps you focus on the difference. 

Viz 1 --> was effective in getting the point across. 

The political behind it --> is enough being done? inaction by the local governmeent? 

Action - make your voice heard?

What is this telling you? Telling the story of US capitalism. How steal companies are continuously not being held account for the risks that they are putting people through, especially that these residents are low income. So there is a blatant disregard for the effects that this is having. 
Anythign conrusing : nothing 
Anything suprrisingL yes, about the cancer risk, surprising and why the EPA is not holding them accountable to the standards it has put in place. Very pormiment env racism.

For viz 1: add a unit on the y axis. and add a year of when these caclulations were made.
fOR VIZ 2: timeline is good. Clarify it's people (unit) --> try with a unit chart (similar to minimum wage unit chart).

Thoughts on additional viz: more breakdown of demographics of clariton residents (age, race, gender etc..).

Read text first, then viz then go back to text. Did help, complementary.

what do you want to do? burn down the steel factory.


Christina: woman, early 20s, current graduate student, no data background, domestic student

wHAT IS THIS telling you? there is major pollution in clairton and it's environmental racism because majhority of people are poc
Confusing? no. 
Suprising? there's no policy alternatives yet
Nothing confusing about the graohs
but need a poc demographics breakdown.
Visual then text. complementary enough? yes
Create a policy alternative for this. Interested to see if Clairton is a red zone. Interested in light of her own work.
