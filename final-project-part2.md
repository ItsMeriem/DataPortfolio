# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience is Allegheny County residents broadly. This story is meant for any Allegheny county residents who are able to take action towards building a safer future for the residents of Clairton, PA. This includes voters who can pressure local government officials to enforce environmental compliance. It also includes people (voters or non voters) who are able to work with advocacy groups to achieve change.

To identify a sample of interviewees that is representative of my target audience, I focused on people who live in Allegheny county. I made sure that my sample has a representative sample across gender and race. I also would like to ensure that my story is accessible to people without a data background so two of my interviewees do not have a data background.

## Interview findings

I interviewed three Allegheny county residents:
- Interviewee 1: man, late '20s, has a strong quantitative background.
- Interviewee 2: woman, mid '20s, graduate student, no data background
- Interviewee 3: woman, early '20s, has no data background.


| Questions                      | Interview 1                    | Interview 2                    | Interview 3                    |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| What did you learn from this story? | "Government cares more about supporting the steel industry than health outcomes of residents, especially poor people."| "Steal companies are continuously not being held account for the risks that they are putting people through, especially that these residents are low income." | "There is major pollution in clairton and it's an environmental justice issue." |
|In regards to the story, did you find anything confusing or surprising? | There was not enough info to understand if the $6 million worth of fines that the plant got was a big or small amount. Generally, it seems like a small amount for a large corporation. Was the $6 million accrued over multiple violations or one violation?| "Not confusing but surprising that the EPA is not doing more to hold them accountable. Are the fines not effective? Are they not hurting the corporation enough?" | Nothing confusing. Surprising that no policies are in place to handle this issue.|
| For the bar chart, anything you find confusing or surprising? What would you change? | Effective in getting the point across.| Need to add a unit on the y axis, and clarify what year is this data from | Clear |
| For the timeline, anything you find confusing or surprising? What would you change? | Is it a logarithmic scale? Overall, effective but unclear about the scale? | Timeline works. Need to clarify the unit (people). You can also try this with a unit chart.| Clear|
| For the line graph, anything you find confusing or surprising? What would you change? | Label the y axis and include the unit. | Clear | Clear|
| Anything else you would like to share about the data visualizations? | No. | I would like to see a breakdown of additional demographics of Clairton residents (age, race etc..) | Since you mention that Clairton residents are primarily people of color, you need to provide the data behind that.|
| What would you remove or add to this story | Dive deepeer in the politics behind it. Look into the fines more. Is the government not doing enough? Why aren't they responding to the fines? How do these fines compare to fines given in other states? | Learn more about the demographics breakdown of Clairton residents. | I would add a breakdown by race of Clairton residents.|



# Identified changes for Part III
Generally, the interviewees easily understood the topic and seemed to grasp the message I was trying to convey. I was pleased with how easy they understood the graphs. There were a few common observations that I'd like to work on:

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clarifying units across all three graphs | I will include the units on the y-axes for both the bar chart and the line graph. And I'll include the unit in the timeline as well.|
| Two our of three interviewees mentioned that adding a demographics breakdown by race of Clairton residents would help clarify the point about environmental racism towards the end of the piece.| I will add another section and include a graph that shows the breakdown by race of Clairton residents (and maybe compare it to other areas with better air quality). I will also move the quote about environmental racism to be next to this new graph instead.|
| Two ouf of three interviewees were curious / confused about what the local and federal governments were doing (or not) to enforce compliance with environmental regulation. They were confused if the fines were too low. And they seemed curious about the politics behind the issue.| I will do additional research to better understand how local and federal governemnts have responded, or not, to violations by USS Clairton Plant and if the fines that have been issued are incentive enough to reduce environmental violations. If I find data on this angle, I will include a section on it too.|


The interviews were very insightful. People had shared confusions which will help me guide my story further.
