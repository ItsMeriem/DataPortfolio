<h1 align="center">Allegheny County Analysis </h1>

<h3 align="center">Introduction</h3>
I conducted this analysis as part of a 3-hour long Data Challenge.

The primary goal of this challenge is to analyze two datasets and prepare a cross-tabulation report that can help the county understand the relationship between various demographics (age, gender, ..) and the estimated probability of a person being at risk of death and/or jail.

<h3 align="center">Datasets</h3>
As part of this challenge, I was provided two datasets relating to one of county’s welfare interventions:
1. Demographics Dataset: It contains demographics variables (age, sex, race, history of opiod use etc.. ) for each person 
2. Risk Scores Dataset: It includes out-of-sample risk scores for two outcomes (mortality and jail). These scores represent the estimated probability of a person being at risk of death and jail.

<h3 align="center">Task and Methodology</h3>

I was tasked to create two cross-tabulations reports (one for each outcome) showing for each demographic category, the:
• Population %: The percentage of the total population.
• Avg Risk Score: The average risk score for each feature category/bin.
• Top 1%, 5% and 10%: The average risk score for the top 1%, 5%, 10% highest risk scores within the category.


The goal of the cross tabs is to 
1. Understand the demographic breakdown of the groups an intervention would be targeted towards if the model is used, and
2. Understand how risk level varies across groups (i.e. gender or age buckets or people with a history of opioid use).

    print("Hello, World!")
